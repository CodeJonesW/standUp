standUp is an idea I had revolving on communicating daily standUps with ease. I used designing this frontend as an opportunity to learn flex css attributes to create a dynamic message board like app where teams would be post standUps. This could be an awesome slack add-on.

My initial layout design and dynamic rendering are completed but can always be improved.
I am casually hacking on standUp in my free time as a fun project.
